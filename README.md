# WATCopter
The WATCopter is an app controlled quadcopter built from scratch for SE101 at the University of Waterloo.
An Android app was developed to send input over Bluetooth to a module connected to an Arduino UNO.
The Arduino then signalled the motors to turn on through ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers), generating a lift
force that allowed flight. An extensive amout of research was done concerning the hardware and software
components of the drone as we lacked knowledge and experience with hardware related projects. We researched what
components were optimal for our purposes, how to establish communication between the Bluetooth module and our Android app,
arming and calibration of the brushless DC motors, the wiring of the individual components, and how the IMU (inertial measurement unit)
functions and how it can help with stabilizing the flight of our drone.
